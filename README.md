Hand gesture recognition and voice conversion for dough and dumb:
  HGRVC (Hand Gesture Recognition and Voice Conversion) system localizes and 
  track the hand gestures of the dumb and deaf people in order to maintain a 
  communication channel with the other people. The detection of hand gestures can 
  be done using web camera. The pictures are then converted into standard size with 
  the help of pre-processing. The aim of this project is to develop a system that can 
  convert the hand gestures into text. The focus of this project is to place the pictures 
  in the database and with database matching the image is converted into text. The 
  detection involves observation of hand movement. The method gives output in text 
  format that helps to reduce the communication gap between deaf-mute and people.
